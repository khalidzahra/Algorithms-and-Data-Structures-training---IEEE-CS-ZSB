/**
Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by 3 or end with the digit 3

in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.

Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than 0
) integers which he likes: 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,14,16,â€¦. Output the k-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from 1).
